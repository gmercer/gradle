### Set the character set used for filtering files in CopySpec

By default, file filtering using `CopySpec` uses the default platform character set to read and write filtered files.
This can cause problems if, for example, the files are encoded using `UTF-8` but the default platform character set is another one.

You can now define the character set to use when reading and writing filtered files per `CopySpec`, e.g.:

    task filter(type: Copy) {
        from 'some/place'
        into 'somewhere/else'
        expand(version: project.version)
        filteringCharset = 'UTF-8'
    }

See the “[Filtering files](userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:filtering_files)” section of the “Working with files chapter” in the user guide for more information and examples of using this new feature.

This was contributed by [Jean-Baptiste Nizet](https://github.com/jnizet).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

### Support for running Gradle on Java 6

Running Gradle using Java 6 is now deprecated, and support will be removed in Gradle 3.0.

It will continue to be possible to build JVM based projects for Java 6, by running Gradle using Java 7 and configuring Gradle to use Java 6 to compile, test and run your code.

## Potential breaking changes

### Gradle implementation dependencies are not visible to plugins at development time

Implementing a Gradle plugin requires the declaration of `gradleApi()`
to the `compile` configuration. The resolved dependency encompasses the
entire Gradle runtime including Gradle's third party dependencies
(e.g. Guava). Any third party dependencies declared by the plugin might
conflict with the ones pulled in by the `gradleApi()` declaration. Gradle
does not apply conflict resolution. As a result The user will end up with
two addressable copies of a dependency on the compile classpath and in
 the test runtime classpath.

In previous versions of Gradle the dependency `gradleTestKit()`, which
relies on a Gradle runtime, attempts to address this problem via class
relocation. The use of `gradleApi()` and `gradleTestKit()` together
became unreliable as classes of duplicate name but of different content
were added to the classpath.

With this version of Gradle proper class relocation has been implemented
 across the dependencies `gradleApi()`, `gradleTestKit()` and the published
 Tooling API JAR. Projects using any of those dependencies will not
 conflict anymore with classes from third party dependencies used by
 the Gradle runtime. Classes from third-party libraries provided by
 the Gradle runtime are no longer "visible" at compile and test
 time.
